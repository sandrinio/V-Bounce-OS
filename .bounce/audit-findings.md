# V-Bounce OS — Audit Findings
> Generated: 2026-03-12. Temporary file — delete after actioning.

## Status: Nearly Complete

### Gaps (by priority)

#### DEFERRED — npm Not Published
- Task 18 was planned but never executed
- `package.json` has `bin`, `files`, and `"type": "module"` already configured
- `.npmignore` exists and is scoped correctly
- **Action:** Run `npm publish` once ready (deferred to later)

#### MEDIUM — Package Conflict Risk
- `package.json` serves two purposes: VS Code extension (`vbounce-studio`) AND npm CLI (`vbounce`)
- `"type": "module"` added for CLI scripts may conflict with esbuild CJS build for the extension
- **Action:** Verify extension builds correctly; consider splitting into monorepo workspaces if it breaks

#### LOW — .gitignore Incomplete
- Missing entries for generated/ephemeral files:
  - `.bounce/state.json`
  - `.bounce/trends.md`
  - `.bounce/sprint-context.md`
  - `.bounce/improvement-suggestions.md`
  - `.bounce/sprint-summary-*.md`
- **Action:** Add 5 lines to `.gitignore`

#### DEFERRED — Scribe YAML Frontmatter
- Explicitly left out by user decision
- Scribe reports are plain markdown, not validated by `validate_report.mjs`
- Violates CLAUDE.md Rule 12 ("Agent Reports MUST use YAML Frontmatter")
- **Action:** Revisit in a future sprint if machine-parsing of Scribe output becomes needed

- `skills/agent-team/SKILL.md` split: 486 → 142 lines + 4 reference files
- On-demand skills: doc-manager, vibe-code-review, write-skill, improve no longer always-loaded
- Brain files for all 6 tools: CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, copilot/, windsurf/, cursor-rules/
- Self-improvement loop: `sprint_trends.mjs` + `suggest_improvements.mjs` + `improvement-log.md`
- 3 lessons graduated to `developer.md` permanent rules
- Archive naming unified to `S-{XX}` (D02-S02 merged into S-02)
- Legacy scripts removed: `sync_statuses.mjs`, `verify_framework.mjs`, `verify_framework.sh`
- `vbounce.config.json` with context budget settings
