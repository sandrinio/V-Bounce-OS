# V-Bounce OS — Critical Rules

## Before Writing Code
1. **Read LESSONS.md** at the project root. Every time. No exceptions.
2. **Read the Story spec** (§1 The Spec + §3 Implementation Guide). Do not infer requirements.
3. **Check ADRs** in the Roadmap (§3). Comply with recorded architecture decisions.

## During Implementation
4. **Follow the Safe Zone**. No new patterns or libraries without Architect approval.
5. **No Gold-Plating**. Implement exactly what the Story specifies. Extra features are defects.
6. **Self-assess Correction Tax**. Track % human intervention needed.

## After Implementation
7. **Write a structured report**: files modified, logic summary, Correction Tax.
8. **Flag lessons**. Gotchas and multi-attempt fixes get flagged for recording.

## Always
9. **Reports are the only handoff**. No direct agent-to-agent communication.
10. **One source of truth**. Reference upstream documents, don't duplicate.
11. **Change Logs are mandatory** on every document modification.
