# Adding V-Bounce OS to Any Repo

Step-by-step guide to set up V-Bounce OS in an existing or new project.

## Prerequisites

- A git repository (V-Bounce OS uses branches and worktrees)
- At least one supported AI coding tool installed
- The V-Bounce OS folder (this repo)

## Step 1: Copy the Framework

Copy the `skills/` and `templates/` directories into your project root:

```bash
# From your project root
cp -r /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/skills/ ./skills/
cp -r /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/templates/ ./templates/
```

These are the core of V-Bounce OS — skills define agent behavior, templates define document structure.

## Step 2: Deploy Brain File for Your AI Tool

Pick the tool you're using and deploy the corresponding brain file:

### Claude Code
```bash
cp /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/brains/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md

# Deploy subagent configs
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/brains/claude-agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

### Codex CLI (OpenAI)
```bash
cp /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/brains/AGENTS.md ./AGENTS.md
```

### Cursor
```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/brains/cursor-rules/*.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

### Gemini CLI
```bash
cp /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/brains/GEMINI.md ./GEMINI.md
```

### Antigravity
```bash
cp /path/to/V-Bounce-OS/brains/GEMINI.md ./GEMINI.md
cp -r skills/ .agents/skills/
```

### Multiple tools
If you use more than one tool on the same project, deploy all of them — they're compatible and describe the same process.

## Step 3: Initialize Planning Documents

Create the `product_plans/` directory and start with the Charter:

```bash
mkdir -p product_plans
```

Then ask your AI agent:
> "Read the doc-manager skill and create a Charter for this project."

The document hierarchy builds from there:
1. Charter (what and why)
2. Roadmap (releases, ADRs, constraints)
3. Epics (feature scope)
4. Stories (implementation contracts)
5. Delivery Plan (sprint execution)
6. Risk Registry (cross-cutting risks)

## Step 4: Set Up Git Infrastructure

Add ephemeral directories to `.gitignore`:

```bash
# Worktrees are ephemeral — created during bounce, removed after merge
echo ".worktrees/" >> .gitignore

# Active reports are ephemeral — they live in worktrees during bounce
echo ".bounce/reports/" >> .gitignore
echo ".bounce/sprint-report.md" >> .gitignore
```

The `.worktrees/` directory holds isolated worktrees during bouncing — these are temporary and get removed after each story merges. Active reports in `.bounce/reports/` are working files that get archived after each story completes.

The `.bounce/archive/` directory is **committed to git** — it contains the full history of every sprint: all agent reports, sprint reports, escalation reports, and merge reports. This is your audit trail.

## Step 5: Create LESSONS.md

Create an empty lessons file at the project root:

```bash
touch LESSONS.md
```

Every agent reads this before doing work. It accumulates project-specific rules, gotchas, and constraints discovered during sprints.

## Step 6: Start Your First Sprint

Ask your AI agent:
> "Read the agent-team skill and start a sprint for the first delivery."

The agent will:
1. Cut a sprint branch from main
2. Create worktrees for each story
3. Run the Bounce loop (Dev → QA → Architect)
4. Merge completed stories
5. Generate a Sprint Report for your review

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Brain File | Deploy To |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` + `claude-agents/*.md` | Project root + `.claude/agents/` |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` | Project root |
| Cursor | `cursor-rules/*.mdc` | `.cursor/rules/` |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Project root |
| Antigravity | `GEMINI.md` + skills copy | Project root + `.agents/skills/` |

## Brain Files

```
brains/
├── SETUP.md               — This file
├── CLAUDE.md              — Claude Code brain
├── AGENTS.md              — Codex CLI brain
├── GEMINI.md              — Gemini CLI / Antigravity brain
├── claude-agents/         — Claude Code subagent configs
│   ├── developer.md

```

Each brain file is self-contained and authoritative for its tool. When updating V-Bounce OS rules, update each brain file directly and keep them in sync.
