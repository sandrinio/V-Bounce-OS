# V-Bounce OS — Integrity Audit

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-26
**Scope**: All templates, skills, agent configs, brain files, cursor rules

---

## 1. STATE MACHINE INCONSISTENCY — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: HIGH — Blocker**

The V-Bounce state machine had "Ready for Review" and "Ready for QA" swapped relative to the actual Developer → QA → Architect sequence.

**Resolution**: Renamed to `QA Passed` and `Architect Passed` (Option C — past-tense naming). Updated across all 10 files: agent-team/SKILL.md, BRAINS.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, vbounce-process.mdc, delivery_plan.md, story.md, doc-manager/SKILL.md, and Delivery Plan Sync table.

New state machine:
```
Backlog → Bouncing → QA Passed → Architect Passed → Sprint Review → Done
              ↘          ↘              ↘
           Escalated   Escalated     Escalated
```

---

## 2. DELIVERY PLAN SYNC TABLE — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: HIGH — Consistency issue**

Fixed alongside #1. The Delivery Plan Sync table now reads:
- QA passes → "QA Passed"
- Architect passes → "Architect Passed"

---

## 3. DELIVERY PLAN TEMPLATE — MISSING §5 "OPEN QUESTIONS" — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: MEDIUM — Process gap**

Added §5b Open Questions to the Delivery Plan template between Context Pack Status and Completed Sprints.

---

## 4. PRODUCT_PLANS FOLDER NOT DEFINED — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: MEDIUM — File path ambiguity**

Standardized on `product_plans/` with delivery folders, epic subfolders, and archive. Updated all brain files, doc-manager, agent-team, and templates with consistent paths.

---

## 5. SCRIBE AGENT — NO EDIT TOOL BUT NEEDS TO UPDATE FILES

**Severity: LOW — Design question** — ACCEPTED (by design)

The Scribe uses Write (whole-file replacement) intentionally. For documentation files, this is acceptable since Scribe generates complete docs, not patches.

---

## 6. agent-team SKILL DESCRIPTION DOESN'T MENTION SCRIBE — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: LOW — Triggering gap**

Added Scribe to the YAML description field and added "generating product documentation" to the description.

---

## 7. BOUNCE COUNT AMBIGUITY — QA vs ARCHITECT — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: MEDIUM — Process gap**

Clarified in agent-team/SKILL.md:
- Step 3: "If **QA** bounce count >= 3 → Escalated"
- Step 4: "If **Architect** bounce count >= 3 → Escalated"
- Edge Case: "When QA bounce count >= 3 OR Architect bounce count >= 3"

Escalation applies to each gate independently.

---

## 8. WHERE DOES THE SCRIBE WORK? — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: MEDIUM — Process gap**

Documented in agent-team/SKILL.md Step 7: Scribe runs on `main` after the sprint merge. Documentation is committed as a follow-up commit on `main`.

---

## 9. SPRINT REPORT TEMPLATE MISSING — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: MEDIUM — Template gap**

Created `templates/sprint_report.md` with: §1 What Was Delivered (user-facing vs internal vs not completed), §2 Story Results, §3 Execution Metrics (AI Performance + V-Bounce Quality + Per-Story Breakdown), §4 Lessons Learned, §5 Process Improvements.

---

## 10. CHANGE_QUEUE.md — REFERENCED BUT NO TEMPLATE

**Severity: LOW — Missing artifact** — DEFERRED

The CHANGE_QUEUE.md is a lightweight operational artifact (just a list of queued changes). A formal template is not needed — the Team Lead can create it ad hoc when mid-sprint charter/roadmap changes are requested.

---

## 11. doc-manager DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT PRODUCT DOCS OR SCRIBE — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: LOW — Stale reference**

Added DevOps and Scribe to the Agent Integration table. Added Sprint Report to Template Locations.

---

## 12. STORY STATE NAMING CONFUSION — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: MEDIUM — UX confusion**

Resolved by #1. "QA Passed" and "Architect Passed" are unambiguous — anyone reading the Delivery Plan immediately knows where the story stands.

---

## 13. LESSONS.md RECORDING — WHO APPROVES?

**Severity: LOW — Process clarity** — CLARIFIED (no code change needed)

Lesson recording happens at Sprint Consolidation (Step 7.6), not mid-bounce. The Lead batches all flagged lessons from agent reports and presents them to the user for approval. The lesson skill's "Never record without user approval" rule applies at this step. No file change needed — Step 7.6 already says "Record lessons (with user approval)."

---

## 14. REACT-BEST-PRACTICES — FRAMEWORK LOCK-IN

**Severity: LOW — Design limitation** — ACCEPTED (known boundary)

V-Bounce OS ships with React/Next.js best practices because that's the initial target framework. For non-React projects, the Developer agent config should be updated to reference the appropriate framework skill. Future improvement: abstract to a generic "code-best-practices" dispatcher.

---

## 15. ARCHITECT AGENT — NO ACCESS TO RISK REGISTRY WRITE — ✅ RESOLVED

**Severity: LOW — Process gap**

Updated doc-manager Agent Integration table to clarify: Architect flags risks in their report, Team Lead writes to the Risk Registry. The table now says "Risk flags (in report — Lead writes to Registry)."
